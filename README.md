# Front and Back end integration

To have and usable application is needed to connect to back end server. For that we use Apache2. All commands in this page are for Ubuntu 14.10

## Installing Apache2

	sudo apt-get install apache2
	
## Installing proxy http module to redirect rest calls to back end servlet

	sudo a2enmod proxy_http
	
## Configuring Apache
### Serving project files

To have the ability to develop Front End without copying files to Apache2 directory every time you change something, we have to configure DocumentRoot to point to project root directory.

Edit 000-default.conf

	 sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

Change DocumentRoot and make sure Apache has rights to read the target folder.

	DocumentRoot /path/to/project
	
Also add those lines to the configuration just bellow DocumentRoot
		
	<Directory />
        Require all granted
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
        AllowOverride All
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

### Proxy configuration

Configure proxy to forward rest request to Back End servlet

	ProxyRequests Off
	ProxyPreserveHost On

	ProxyPass /rest http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest
	ProxyPassReverse /rest http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest

You should be able to run the whole application. Make sure to change Back End address to the one you are using, if not localhost.
